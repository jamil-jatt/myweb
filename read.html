<p>There‚Äôs nothing quite like Halloween. Perhaps it‚Äôs the rare treat of dressing up in costumes, or the classic icons that accompany October 31st: from ghosts in clanking chains to slinky black cats, grim Jack-O-Lanterns to ghastly witches flying over the moon‚Äî the list goes on! It‚Äôs plain to see why All Hallow‚Äôs Eve is one of the most visually stimulating holidays on the calendar.</p>

<p>What better way to celebrate this season of sensory-overload than with some classroom creative writing! Gather round, teachers‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve assembled a list of 5 fun and frightfully üëª festive Kidblog writing prompts to share with your students to really get them in the Halloween spirit. Each activity is ranked for age-appropriateness, starting with kindergarten-friendly and ending with more sophisticated story ideas for high-school students</p>

    <div><h3> Coloring Book + Captions</h3>
    <p>Print off a spooky Halloween coloring book page depicting a festive fall scene‚Ä¶ ghosts, witches, skeletons, oh my! There are tons of websites out there that offer great print outs‚Ä¶ even Google Image Search is a great place to start (You can even use the one below). Let your students express themselves with crayons and markers, then scan and upload each image into your Kidblog class. From there, encourage kids to write a couple of descriptive sentences about their own scenes, and publish them for fellow classmates to see!</p>

<div><h3>Spooktastic Sensations.</h3>
   <p>Have your kids blog about Halloween using their five senses. What are the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and feelings of this spooky holiday? This is a great opportunity to encourage the use of creative literary devices, such as similes, metaphors, and alliteration.</p>
</div>
 <div><h3> Halloween Hall of Fame.</h3>
<p>Ask students to blog about a specific Halloween memory ‚Äì a favorite costume, trick-or-treating experience, haunted house visit, or other cherished Halloween memory. Focus on the 5 Ws of storytelling (or newswriting). Who else was there? What did you do? When did you do it? Where were you? Why is it your favorite memory?</p>
</div>  
<div><h3>Persuasion Invasion</h3>
<p>Some schools forbid students to dress up in Halloween costumes. Have your students take on this debate. Do they agree, or disagree with schools that ban costumes? Ask them to blog a traditional 5 paragraph persuasive essay addressing their stand on the issue of celebrating Halloween in the classroom: introduction, three supporting arguments, and conclusion.</p>
<div><h3> Writing from the Crypt</h3></div>
<p>‚ÄúIt was a dark and stormy night.‚Äù Toss that sentence at your kids. Tell them to run with it. Have them blog any sort of story they wish, so long as it begins with that sentence. Challenge them to invent something delightfully unique from an otherwise clich√© opener.

    Have fun üôÇ</p></div>
